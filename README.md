# Networking & Wireshark Basics

This repository documents my hands-on learning of networking
fundamentals and packet analysis using Wireshark on Kali Linux.

## Topics Covered
- TCP vs UDP
- TCP 3-Way Handshake
- DNS Resolution
- HTTP vs HTTPS
- ARP Protocol
- ARP Poisoning (MITM concept)

## What I Observed
- DNS queries reveal destination domains even when HTTPS is used
- TCP handshake clearly shows connection setup
- HTTP traffic is readable, HTTPS is encrypted
- ARP poisoning exploits trust at Layer 2

## Tools Used
- Kali Linux
- Wireshark

## Status
Learning in progress 🚀
