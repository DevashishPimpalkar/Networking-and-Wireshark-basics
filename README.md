# 🛡️ Network Traffic Analysis using Wireshark

Hands-on practice with packet analysis on Kali Linux to understand real network communication and security behavior.

---

## 🔍 What This Project Covers
- TCP vs UDP traffic behavior
- TCP 3-Way Handshake analysis
- DNS query & response inspection
- HTTP vs HTTPS packet comparison
- ARP requests and ARP poisoning (lab environment)

---

## 🧪 Tools & Environment
- Kali Linux
- Wireshark
- Linux terminal utilities (ping, nslookup, curl)

---

## 📊 Key Learnings
- DNS traffic reveals domain-level intent before encryption
- TCP handshake confirms reliable connections
- HTTPS encrypts payload but metadata is still visible
- ARP works on trust, which can be exploited in LAN attacks

---

## 🚧 Status
Learning in progress. More packet analysis scenarios will be added.
