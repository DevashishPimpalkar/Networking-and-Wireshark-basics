# Network Traffic Analysis with Wireshark 🦈

This repository documents my hands-on learning in networking and packet analysis
using **Kali Linux** and **Wireshark**.

## What this repo contains
- Practical notes on TCP/IP, DNS, HTTP/HTTPS
- Wireshark packet captures & filters
- Observations from real network traffic
- Basics of ARP & MITM concepts

## Why Wireshark?
Packet captures are rich data sources.
By analyzing real traffic, we can understand:
- Device intent (DNS)
- Trust relationships (ARP)
- Protocol behavior (TCP vs UDP)

This approach builds strong fundamentals for
**Cybersecurity**, **Network Defense**, and future **AI-based traffic analysis**.

## Status
Learning in progress 🚀  
New analysis and captures will be added regularly.
