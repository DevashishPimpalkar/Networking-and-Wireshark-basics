# Networking and Wireshark Basics

This repository documents my hands-on learning in **computer networking and packet analysis using Wireshark on Kali Linux**.

The focus is on understanding how data moves across networks, how attacks occur at the network layer, and how those attacks can be detected and analyzed.
