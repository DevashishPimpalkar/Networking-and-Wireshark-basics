# Learning Notes – Wireshark & Networking 🦈

## What I practiced today
- TCP vs UDP (when speed matters vs reliability)
- TCP 3-Way Handshake (SYN → SYN-ACK → ACK)
- HTTP vs HTTPS packet behavior
- DNS queries & responses
- ARP & ARP poisoning basics
- Packet capture & filtering in Wireshark

## Wireshark filters I used
- dns
- tcp
- udp
- arp

## Interesting observations
- DNS traffic reveals **intent** (what a device is trying to reach)
- HTTP packets are readable, HTTPS is encrypted
- ARP spoofing works by breaking trust inside the network
- Packet traffic feels like **real conversations between devices**

## Tools
- Kali Linux
- Wireshark

## Status
Learning in progress 🚀  
More captures & analysis coming soon.
