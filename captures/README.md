# Packet Captures

This folder contains packet capture files (.pcap / .pcapng) collected during my learning and experimentation with networking and Wireshark.

## Purpose
- To understand real network traffic
- To analyze protocols like DNS, ARP, TCP, UDP, DHCP
- To practice packet-level thinking (attacker & defender mindset)

## What you’ll find here
- DNS queries and responses
- ARP communication
- DHCP behavior (including spoofing concepts – lab only)
- TCP handshakes and packet flows

## Tools Used
- Wireshark
- Kali Linux
- Ettercap (lab environments only)

> All captures are taken in controlled lab or personal environments for educational purposes only.
