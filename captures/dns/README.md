# DNS Packet Captures

This folder contains DNS traffic captures.

## Observations
- DNS works over UDP (mostly)
- Queries and responses are visible in plaintext
- A vs AAAA record differences observed
- Source = client, Destination = DNS server

## Learning Outcome
Understanding how name resolution works and what metadata attackers can still see even with HTTPS.
